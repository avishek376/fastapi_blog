_This backend application is a blog app developed using **FastAPI**, a modern web framework for building APIs with
Python. The application utilizes **SQLAlchemy**, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, to interact with the **SQLite
database**._

```Here's a brief explanation of the components:

FastAPI: FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently in Python. It leverages Python's type system to provide auto-generated API documentation and validation, making it easy to develop and maintain APIs.

SQLAlchemy ORM: SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a way to interact with databases using Python objects, making database operations more intuitive and Pythonic.

SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system. It is well-suited for development and prototyping due to its simplicity and minimal setup requirements.

JWT Authentication : JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties. Jet Authentication is a lightweight library for implementing JWT-based authentication in FastAPI applications.```
